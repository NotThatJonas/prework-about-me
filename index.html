      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a senior product manager as a vendor at Microsoft for over a year now and I am passionate about what I do but to take that next step in my career I need to build a stronger technical foundation. In addition, I want to start building web applications myself without the need for others to assist. I believe that the UW coding boot-camp can provide me with both the technical skills I will need to prototype my own applications and help me move into the next stage of my career.</p>
